```javascript
const query = { name: /John/i }; // Case-insensitive search

// ... later in the code ...

if (user.name === 'john') {
  // ... some logic ...
}
```
This code snippet uses a case-insensitive regular expression in the MongoDB query to find documents where the `name` field matches 'John' irrespective of the case (e.g., 'john', 'JOHN', 'JoHn'). However, the subsequent comparison `user.name === 'john'` in the code is case-sensitive and might fail to match even if the MongoDB query successfully finds a document. This subtle difference in case sensitivity can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs if not properly handled.
