# MongoDB Case Sensitivity Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error related to case sensitivity when working with MongoDB queries and JavaScript comparisons. The bug occurs due to the difference in case sensitivity handling between the MongoDB query and the subsequent comparison in the JavaScript code.  The solution offers a more robust approach that handles case sensitivity consistently.

## Bug Description
A case-insensitive MongoDB query is used to find documents. However, a case-sensitive comparison is performed later in the application code, leading to potential inconsistencies and bugs if the compared strings have different capitalization.
